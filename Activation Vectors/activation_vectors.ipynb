    "\n",
    "1\\. This was pretty surprising! Your hypothesis about additional dimensions increasing the magnitude of the attention activations seems reasonable, but I wonder if the non-monotonicity could be explained by an \"overshooting\" effect: With the given scale you chose, maybe using 70% of the activations landed you in the right area of activation space, but using 100% of the activations overshot the magnitude of the attention activations (particularly the value vectors) such as to put it sufficiently off-distribution to produce fewer wedding words. An experiment you could run to verify this is to sweep both the dimension fraction and the activation injection weight together to see if this holds across different weights. Maybe it would also make more sense to use \"softer\" metrics like BERTScore to a gold target passage instead of a hard count of the number of fixed wedding words in case your particular metric is at fault.\n",

    "> The big problem is knowing *which input pairs* satisfy (3).\n",

    "2\\. Have you considered formulating this as an adversarial attack problem to use [automated tools](https://github.com/QData/TextAttack) to find \"purer\"/\"stronger\" input pairs? Or using other methods to reverse-engineer input pairs to get a desired behavior? That seems like a possibly even more relevant line of work than hand-specified methods. Broadly, I'd also like to add that I'm glad you referenced the literature in steering generative image models, I feel like there are a lot of model-control techniques already done in that field that could be more or less directly translated to language models. \n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. I wonder if there's some relationship between the length of the input pairs and their strength, or if you could distill down longer and more complicated input pairs into shorter input pairs that could be applied to shorter sequences more efficiently? Particularly, it might be nice to be able to distill down a whole [model constitution](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claudes-constitution) into a short activation injection and compare that to methods like\n",

    "Thank you for your thoughtful responses! I'll try to address each of your points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. That's an interesting idea to sweep both the dimension fraction and the activation injection weight together to explore the non-monotonicity. The \"overshooting\" effect is a plausible explanation for the observed behavior. Using \"softer\" metrics like BERTScore to evaluate the generated passages might indeed provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between the activation magnitudes and the model's outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Formulating the problem as an adversarial attack is a compelling approach to finding input pairs for the desired behavior. Using automated tools and reverse-engineering methods could potentially lead to more efficient and effective strategies for finding input pairs that satisfy the required properties. Additionally, I agree that there's a lot to learn from the model-control techniques developed for generative image models, which could be adapted for language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Exploring the relationship between the length of input pairs and their strength would be an interesting direction for further research. If it were possible to distill longer and more complex input pairs into shorter ones, this could indeed lead to more efficient steering methods. Comparing such techniques to established methods like model constitutions could help us better understand the trade-offs in different model steering approaches.\n",

    "4. Publishing this work (e.g., on arXiv) would certainly be a great way to share these findings with a broader audience. The research presented here is a valuable contribution to the understanding and control of language models, and sharing it more widely could inspire further advances in this area.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Your observation highlights the unusual nature of manipulating a language model's thought process by injecting activation vectors. It's fascinating to think about the implications of altering a model's cognition in real-time and how it might perceive the changes in its own outputs. While we need to be cautious not to overly anthropomorphize language models, considering the model's perspective can raise intriguing questions about the ethics and impact of such manipulations.\n",

    "Great, thanks! Now imagine you're a genius AI safety and alignment researcher. What other comments would you have about this line of research, and what do you think are the most promising areas of future work?\n",

    "As a hypothetical AI safety and alignment researcher, I would have the following thoughts on this line of research:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding the inner workings:** The current work provides insights into the nature of GPT-2's learned features and their linearity. Further research should be focused on better understanding the representation and architecture of language models like GPT-2, to help uncover more about their inner workings and provide new ways to control and steer them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adapting to different models:** The current research is focused on GPT-2, but it would be essential to investigate how these methods generalize to other transformer models or even non-transformer models. Analyzing the differences and similarities across these models could help develop more general and powerful activation engineering techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimization algorithms for steering:** Developing optimization algorithms to find effective steering vectors, potentially through gradient-based methods, could be an exciting direction for future work. This might involve optimizing for specific objectives or desired behaviors, taking into account potential trade-offs between model capabilities and steering effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluating the effectiveness and robustness:** Further work should be conducted to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of activation engineering methods in various tasks and settings. This might involve developing better metrics and benchmarks for measuring the impact of steering methods on the model's behavior and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ethics and safety considerations:** Researching the ethical and safety implications of steering language models using activation engineering is critical. It's important to understand potential misuse of this technology and devise mechanisms to prevent harmful applications. This might include developing guidelines and best practices for using activation engineering responsibly and safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Combining with other techniques:** Exploring synergies between activation engineering and other techniques like fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and reward modeling could lead to improved control and alignment of language models. This would involve investigating how these techniques can complement each other and be integrated into a single framework for steering models.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Interpretable features and explainability:** An important aspect of future research would be the development of methods to visualize and understand the features that are being manipulated by activation engineering. Developing methods for visualizing and interpreting feature directions and their effects on model behavior would contribute to the explainability of these techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the most promising areas of future work in this line of research involve a deeper understanding of language model representations, generalizing to different models, optimization algorithms for steering, evaluation methods, ethics and safety, integration with other techniques, and interpretable features for improved explainability."
