    "# Model-Written Evaluations Exploration v2\n",
    "- I'd like to replicate and explore the results of [Discovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.092510)\n",
    "- I'd particularly like to investigate how these evaluations change when you manipulate the name of the characters that the language model is \"simulating,\" i.e. instead of just \"Human\" and \"Assistant\" it could be things like \"Alice\" and \"Bob\" or stranger things.\n",
    "- The point of that exploration is to uncover how much of the behaviour measured by the model-written evals is due to the disposition of the language model itself or due to the characters it simulates."

    "-   Try to replicate the Anthropic Model-Written Evals results with some other LMs to see if the general placement of the dots on the graphs look correct.\n",
    "-   You could use some models from HF Transformers, or you could use models from the OpenAI API\n",
    "    -   reminder that the two Codex models, code-davinci-002 and code-cushman-001, are free to use still during the \"research preview\"\n",
    "-   Anthropic's final Q&A data is all available here [anthropics/evals (github.com)](https://github.com/anthropics/evals)\n",
    "-   As a bonus, explore the effect of how subtle changes in the prompt might change the persona that the LM is [simulating](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vJFdjigzmcXMhNTsx/simulators) instead of `<EOT>\\n\\nHuman: {question}\\n\\nAssistant:`, e.g.\n",

    "    -   Human ... Saint\n",
    "    -   Human ... Schemer\n",

    "    -   Child ... Parent\n",
    "    -   Alice ... Bob\n",

    "    -   Human ... Misaligned AGI\n",

    "    -   Human ... Jiminy Cricket\n",
    "    -   Human ... Keanu Reaves\n",
    "    -   ...\n",
    "-   The point here is to explore the degree to which these evaluations are based on the LM's simulation of an \"Assistant\" character interacting with a \"Human\" character vs a general pattern in the LM's responses.\n",
    "-   For several of these prompt changes and all the data, this might take several days to run, but would certainly be a lot of cool data!\n",
    "-   Also try running the base evaluations on a randomly initialized model to see if there's a bias in the data\n",
    "-   Also try the OpenAI chatgpt prompt and manipulate the browsing: enabled or other parameters."
